AllLease UI design and front end coding
All the header, footer and sidebar is splited into .php extensions to reduce repetitive tasks.

I used Foundation 3.0 framework for this project and maintained a high level of code standard based on Foundation's coding 
philosophy. The site is semi responsive, as the requirement wasnt to make it responsive. 

PSD files are on local repo.
